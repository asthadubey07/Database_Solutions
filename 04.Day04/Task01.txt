Datatype:-

fot storing the Numeric value we use integer datatypes and according to the size of numbers we use different type of datatypes


Data type	        Range	                                                           
bigint   	-       9,223,372,036,854,775,808  to      9,223,372,036,854,775,807	
int     	-       2,147,483,648              to      2,147,483,647	
smallint    -       32,768                     to      32,767	
tinyint     -	    0                          to      255	






to store the date time we have different type of datatypes

Data types that represent binary values.
Data type	                                       Use when ...
binary	                                           the sizes of the column data entries are consistent(0-8000)bytes
varbinary	                                       the sizes of the column data entries vary considerably (0-8000)bytes.
varbinary(max)	                                   the column data entries exceed 8,000 bytes (0-8000)bytes.





bit                     -           The SQL Server Database Engine optimizes storage of bit columns. If there are 8 or fewer bit columns in a table, the columns are stored as 1 byte. If there are from 9 up to 16 bit columns, the columns are stored as 2 bytes, and so on.

                                    The string values TRUE and FALSE can be converted to bit values: TRUE is converted to 1 and FALSE is converted to 0.



numeric and decimal    -  Numeric data types that have fixed precision and scale. Decimal and numeric are synonyms and can be used interchangeably.




 cursor            -      A data type for variables or stored procedure OUTPUT parameters that contain a reference to a cursor.
 Hierarchid        -      The hierarchyid data type is a variable length, system data type. Use hierarchyid to represent position in a hierarchy.
 sql_variant       -      A data type that stores values of various SQL Server-supported data types.
 xml               -      It's the data type that stores XML data. You can store xml instances in a column, or a variable of xml type.
 uniqueidentifier  -      Is a 16-byte GUID.
 rowversion        -      Is a data type that exposes automatically generated, unique binary numbers within a database. rowversion is generally used as a mechanism for version-stamping table rows. The storage size is 8 bytes
